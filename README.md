# EWeek App 2017

This is the entire source code of the official [EWeek](https://www.uteweek.com/) app of 2017 which is not available yet.

This project is built on top of a fork of [F8](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app) app made by Facebook. Thank you for letting us use this!

## How We Build It

Facebook created a series of tutorials at [makeitopen.com](http://makeitopen.com/) that explain how they built the app, and that dives into using React Native, Redux, Relay, GraphQL, and more.

## Requirements

1. [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) (follow iOS and Android guides)
  - Xcode 7.3 +
2. [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) (only for iOS)
  - Version 1.0+ recommended (`gem install cocoapods --pre`)
3. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads) (needed to run Parse Server locally)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app.git
  $ cd f8app
  ```

2. **Install dependencies** (npm v3+):

  ```
  $ npm install
  $ (cd ios; pod install)        # only for iOS version
  ```

3. **Make sure MongoDB is running:**

  ```
  $ lsof -iTCP:27017 -sTCP:LISTEN
  ```

  NOTE: if installed with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) run `brew info mongo` and
  check out the Caveats section.

  If you prefer to use an external MongoDB server, set `DATABASE_URI`:

  ```
  $ export DATABASE_URI=mongodb://example-mongo-hosting.com:1337/my-awesome-database
  ```

4. **Start Parse/GraphQL servers:**

  ```
  $ npm start
  ```

5. **Import sample data** (the local Parse Server should be running):

  ```
  $ npm run import-data
  ```

  Make sure everything works by visiting:

  * Parse Dashboard: [http://localhost:8080/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dashboard)
  * Graph*i*QL: [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql?query=query+%7B%0A++schedule+%7B%0A++++title%0A++++speakers+%7B%0A++++++name%0A++++++title%0A++++%7D%0A++++location+%7B%0A++++++name%0A++++%7D%0A++%7D%0A%7D)

6. **Running on Android**:

  ```
  $ react-native run-android
  $ adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081   # required to ensure the Android app can
  $ adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080   # access the Packager and GraphQL server
  ```


7. **Running on iOS:**

  ```
  $ react-native run-ios
  ```

## Troubleshooting

> Could not connect to development server

In a separate terminal window run:

  ```
  $ react-native start
  ```
